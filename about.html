        <ul>
            <li> <b><i>In my spare time, I love to:</i></b></li><br><br>
            <li><b>Conduct baking experiments</b><br>
                I love baking. It's not only about creating something delicious. To me, it's an exciting journey to see
                different ingredients, combined in different ways, to produce something magical. It's an art form that
                combines precision, creativity, care, and fun. I love classic recipes as well as riffing to create
                totally new and interesting creations! I also like experimenting with unique ingredients that cater to
                different dietary restrictions and diets. Lately, my experiments have included pandan donuts, caramel
                coconut cookie bars, browned butter banana blondies, and maple pecan snickerdoodles.</li><br><br>
            <li><b>Be active, ideally outdoors</b><br>
                I like being active. This includes group fitness classes,
                hopping on the treadmill or bike, doing yoga - I'm a certified yoga teacher! If possible, I like to get
                outdoors and get in my steps on a long walk or a challenging hike or go camping. Getting some fresh air
                is always great!</li><br><br>
            <li><b>Enjoy a cup of tea</b><br>
                I am a novice tea enthusiast. I love curling up with a good book and a cup of tea, or just sitting in a
                plush comfy seat with some tea. I am interested in tea, its multitude of varieties, and brewing methods.
                I like appreciating the different aspects of tea such as the layered flavors and aromas. Having tea is
                typically a solo activity for me, but I also appreciate that having a cup
                of tea can also be a great way to relax and connect with others.</li><br><br>
